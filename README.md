# AST Parser and Comparison Tool
## Underlying Project
<p>Static Analysis tools like Joern, SVF, and Fraunhofer's CPG tend to contain flaws that can inhibit program analysis. Our project, Supervised by Prof. Paria Shirani at the University of Ottawa, was to find common flaws in these generated graphs, and implement tools that can detect and fix these in generation.</p>
<p>Early on, we found that the lack of a benchmark when comparing ASTs generated by different static analysis tools makes to process slow and innacurate. Since compiler generated ASTs tend to have the highest degree of accuracy, they should be used as a benchmark to facilitate this comparison. Focusing on C and C++, we decided to work with the Clang AST.</p>

## AST Parser
<p>
  The first step in creating a benchmark graph is normalising the Clang AST for comparisons. The parser outputs a simplified JSON file that contains the relevant edges and nodes traversed in the Clang AST.
